## Project Workflow

Performing - User stories/wireframes look great. Looks like you got pretty close to the landing page you planned!

## Technical Requirement

Performing - App is functional. You're really close to fixing the same click bug. This project shows full understanding of course content covered in the first 3 weeks of the course. Great work! While reflecting on this project or working on it further, you should look into how it might benefit with an object oriented approach.

## Code Quality
Performing - Great clean code. I would look for opportunities to abstract functionality into functions. In this way, your code becomes more readable and manageable. Great comments throughout and well indented. I really like that you abstracted functionality into separate files.

## Creativity/Interface
Excelling - The styles are very simple and clean. Their are subtleties throughout the app that makes it really stand out. Background greys changing when you select a match, showing all matches before the game starts, its the little things that make interface really shine. Great work!
